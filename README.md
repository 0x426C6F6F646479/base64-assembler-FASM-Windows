# base64-assembler-FASM-Windows
Just my own base64 written in pure assembler for Windows.

Sometimes it is very convenient to have a small program for encrypting and decrypting base64 at hand.
This program works with Windows-1251. When I used UTF-8 it was a problem with russian symbols on ReadConsoleA API.
Compilled in FASM.
Enjoy it.
